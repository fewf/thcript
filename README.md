thcript - A Scheme Interpreter in JavaScript
=======

Thcript was a vehicle for me to have more hands-on practice with some of JavaScripts more advanced and functional components. 

This project owes much to Peter Norvig's lis.py Scheme interpreter. The overall strategy that Norvig employed is ported to Thcript. Besides mine being in JavaScript (not Python), I've added a few whizbang features:

+ Custom error handling
+ Support for Let statements
+ More flexible functions (his + does not take more than 2 args, mine does.)
